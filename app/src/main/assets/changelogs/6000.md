# ![Revolt for Android 0.6.0](/_android_assets/changelogs/assets/6000/header.png)

## Welcome Beta Ring II ðŸŽ‰

For many of you, this is the first time you're seeing this app. Welcome to the second beta ring!
You'll be helping us test the app and find bugs before we release it to the general public. Everyone
is so excited to have you here!

Crashes are expected, and we're working hard to fix them. If you find a crash, it will be reported
automatically. If you have anything else to say, use the **channels on Jenvolt** or the **Feedback**
button in settings.

## Server Identities are here

Server identities and role colours will now be shown across the app. This should help make the app
feel a lot more like the web client, which is our compatibility target. Servers look a lot closer
now!

We'll still exploring how to best show these identities in user sheets, but for now, they're only
shown inline in chat and in the member list.

## Changelogs

You're reading one right now! New releases will now come with changelogs, so you can see what's
been cooking in the kitchen. We'll also be posting these on the website after general availability,
so feel free to check them out there too.

## Updated to Android 14 SDK

We've updated the app to use the latest Android SDK, which is Android 14. This means we're now
ahead of the actual Android release schedule! 14 is still in beta, but the SDK is stable by now.

This will help us keep the
app [in the Play Store](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11926878?hl=en)
for longer, and it also means we can use the latest and greatest APIs. As always, the app's aim is
to make use of the Android platform as much as possible, and being on the newest SDK helps us do
that.

## Extended Markdown in Bios and Changelogs

There is now a separate **web-based** Markdown renderer, currently in use on user bios and
changelogs.
This renderer is more powerful than the one we use in chat, and it's also more accurate to the web
client. It is a little slower, but we're working on that. The aim will be to instantly render
Markdown in it, however the current placeholder implementation works alright. Look forward to KaTeX
and more!

Now, our focus will go back to the native chat Markdown renderer. It is quite a bit behind in terms
of feature support. Some features (such as KaTeX) will be impossible to implement natively, so we
will be looking at ways to fuse the two renderers together on-demand. As always, this is a long-term
goal, but we're getting there.

## Member List

Here it is, the member list sheet! This is equivalent to the right sidebar on the web client. It
shows all the members of the server, sorted by role and position, along with the correct role colour
and identity.

In the future, you will be able to filter this list by role, and search for members. For now, it's
just a list.

## The Small Things

- Latest and greatest dependency versions are now used, including Kotlin 1.9.10 and Compose 1.5.3.
- Audio player gained a "share URL" menu item.
- Message timestamps now use native time formatting APIs, which means they'll be formatted
  correctly for your locale and will stay accurate in all cases.
- The disconnected/reconnected/connected banner is now using Material You colouring if your theme is
  set to that.
- Roles in the user sheet are now sorted by position.
- If a users' profile is empty or fails to load, the fallback messages are now clearly
  distinguishable as such.
- Debug builds now have "+debug" appended to their version string, an app ID of "chat.revolt.debug",
  and a different name. This allows you to install the debug build alongside the release build.

## Squished Bug Showcase

- Fixed a crash when opening the user sheet for a user that has blocked you.
- Fixed a condition in which messages from yesterday would be shown as "Today" in the chat.
- Fixed a condition in which GIFs would not play in the chat.
- Fixed a condition in which animated WebP images would not play in the chat.
- Fixed a condition in which users were eagerly shown as offline when they were actually online.
- Fixed a condition in which the ripple area for server icons would be too small compared to the
  icon.

## ðŸ«¡âœ¨

That's all for now! We hope you enjoy this release, and we're looking forward to your feedback.
Please report any bugs you find, and let us know what you think of the app so far. Thank you for
testing!
