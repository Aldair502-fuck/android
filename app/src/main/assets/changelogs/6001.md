# ![Revolt on Android 0.6.1](/_android_assets/changelogs/assets/6001/header.png)

Hello Revolters! Onwards to another release.

## Links

This is the big one. Links are here.
You can now tap on links in messages and they will open in your browser.
Never seen before.

Jokes aside, this is obviously very important for usability.

As you can see, it works for channel and user mentions as well! They even have their own special
little highlight.

If you long tap a link, you will be presented with an action sheet. This action sheet allows you to
either open the link in your browser, or copy the link to your clipboard.

Getting this to work has been more difficult than it should have been. The main issue was that
the TextView API in Android should be considered a war crime. One custom touch handler later, and
we have a working solution.

## Custom Emotes in Messages

Custom emotes are now displayed inline in messages. This means that you can now see the emotes
that someone sends.

As one would expect, when a message consists solely of emotes, they will be displayed larger.

## Permissions

This release adds support for channel, server and role permissions. This means that if you don't
have permission to, for instance,
send messages in a channel, you will be notified of that.

This isn't a huge change, but it required some pretty heavy lifting on the development side.

## New Home Screen

There's a cat. 'Nuff said.

## Server Badges

Servers sometimes get verified by Revolt, for example when they're noteworthy communities or when
they're official communities. This release adds support for displaying these badges.

Of course, servers ran by Revolt also get their own special badge that you can see above. Both of
those badges are also
displayed in the server context sheet.

## The Small Things

As always, some additions have not made their own heading. Don't worry, here they are:

- Do not hardcode the attachment authority of the application. If the package name differs, the app
  will not crash when providing an attachment (for example, by sharing a file).
- `WebCompat` will no longer spam Logcat when resolving colours correctly.
- Session token is no longer fetched in every route implementation. This helps make the codebase a
  little cleaner.
- Access control ("DRM"â€”in quotes) is now a native C++ module.
- Member list now has support for group chats.
- Opening the member list in group chats, direct messages or saved messages no longer crashes the
  app.
- Timestamps now have the correct monospaced font.
- If you cannot send messages in a channel, that information will now be displayed in a
  nicer-looking way than before.
- Additional safeguard for sending the same message multiple times by mashing the send button.
- Jenvolt link removed from the settings screen.
- Upgrade the Android Gradle Plugin, twice.
- Empty channels will no longer show as having unread messages.
- Editing a message now correctly causes your text cursor to start at the end of the message.

## Wrapping Up

That's it for this release. If you have any feedback, please let the team know using the usual
channels. We're always happy to hear from you.
