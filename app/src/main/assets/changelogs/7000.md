# ![Revolt on Android 0.7.0](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/1VSp9d6ZZQEYFNtnM0E_MtmaUMQAPIMaLpEvYEKSt8/Slide%2016_9%20-%201%20(7).png)

Hello Revolters! Continuing our roughly monthly release schedule, this is a big one.

## ![Themes](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/OxkrZPo-eJpuXjJ6ZWD-uQrvK9fxhsiEXWSs2MG7fw/Slide%2016_9%20-%202%20(3).png)

"...but Themes were already in the app!", I hear you say. "What's new?", you ask.

Besides a polished, beautiful, and more concise user interface, there's one important addition. You
can now create your own themes and share them with others! Customise every colourful aspect of the
Material 3 design language, and export them to an ultra-compact `.RATO` (Revolt Android Theme
Overrides, but I've been told it means "rat" in Portuguese) file.

Be sure to share your creations in [Jenvolt](https://rvlt.gg/jen)'s #themes channel. I'm sure some
of them will even be uploaded to an official theme repository in the future ðŸ‘€

Wake up, new settings dropped. You can now change your profile picture, profile background and bio
right from the Android app, because it is *essential* that everyone knows you're a furry. I mean,
that you're a gamer. I mean, that you're a furry gamer. I'm sure you get the point.

Of course, around here we also like to emphasise security, so that's why you can now manage your
active devices and sessions right from the app. If you see a device or session you don't recognise,
you can terminate it on the go. If you're paranoid, you can also terminate all other sessions at
once â€” I'm sure this will be useful for some of you.

## ![Emoji Picker](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/tXrdK8EZRCSM9gjtsycwrTldQG9205wxKkU4hx6cXJ/Slide%2016_9%20-%204.png)

What's that next to the send button? Could it be... an emoji picker? Yes, yes it is!
Tap once to see all your servers lined up neatly above the performant grid of emojis. That's the
custom emotes of the servers you're in, of course. Scroll in the server list, all the way, to see
the standard Unicode emoji. Tap on an emoji to add it to your message and spread the joy. There's
even a search bar, if you're into that. I've seen the amount of servers some of you are in â€”
so some of you are definitely into that.

## ![Friends](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/SJ1KCW9QgiYfCN5z7YJUeYzzKicmNya20BLtpVpay5/Slide%2016_9%20-%205.png)

You can now view your incoming friend requests from the app. I'm sure you get lots of them.
Friends are not included and are sold separately.

## ![Status](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/Oz7WdIr0Cu5M2G5Sah51rTlH4la_MD37R5HeX72TPA/Slide%2016_9%20-%206.png)

Look at this status UI. It is simply beautiful â€” and it's so simple to use, too! You can now
set your status right from the app, and get a quick explainer blurb on what each status means. I
mean, what the hell is
a ["Focus"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Ford_Focus_2004.jpg) anyway?

## ![Channel Categories](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/D1iG_sdhhSrHHs_QS6cZDB0zNif57df2tg3Mdratty/Slide%2016_9%20-%207.png)

Lots of people have been asking for this one, and honestly, I've been too. But since I will not let
myself (and you Android folks) fall behind the iOS app, I've implemented it. Channels in the channel
list are now grouped by the category the server's owner has put them in, and are now in the correct
order, too. This is revolutionary.

## Other changes

- Do not show "Copied X to clipboard" toast on Android 12 and later, as the system already shows a
  toast when you copy something.
- Channels should feel like they load faster now, because I am a master at psychology.
- The changelog description for 0.6.1 has been fixed, because I am not a master at copy-pasting.
- Some translations that have been sitting around for a while have been merged in. Apologies for the
  wait. You might hear some more info on Android translations soon, stay tuned.
- Channel mentions now lead you to the correct channel, not the first channel in the server.
- Images load in with a nice fade-in animation now. I can't even describe the impact this has on me,
  it's just so much better.
- If you try to follow an invalid user mention, the resulting error sheet looks a lot nicer than
  before.
- On Android 14, the app will now detect if you only granted partial access to media, and will ask
  you to reconsider. We're up to date!
- The message field has been rewritten, which allows users of certain custom keyboards to type
  again.
- You can now drag images into the message field, as well as insert them from the clipboard and your
  keyboard's GIF picker, for instance.
- Users are now no longer shown as online when actually offline.
- The "Home" page now has a menu button in its top bar which opens the sidebar.
- The "Home" page now has a home icon instead of a text channel icon.
- The indicator showing the current sidebar page now doesn't stay at its previous position when you
  switch pages.
- Embeds no longer show up as empty if scrolled away and then back to.
- System messages now have clickable user mentions, and display the correct user name.
- Release builds no longer log to logcat. This is a security improvement.
- The heart in the about screen is now an emoji heart, because the iOS app has one and we don't want
  to get jealous.
- Synced settings are now fetched when you are successfully authenticated, not when the app starts.
  This makes settings a bit more reliable.
