# Revolt on Android

## Description

This is the official Android app for the [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) chat platform.  
The codebase includes the app itself, as well as an internal library for interacting with the Revolt
API.

| Module | Package       | Description          |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| `:app` | `chat.revolt` | The main app module. |

The API library is part of the `app` module, and is not intended to be used as a standalone library,
as it makes liberal use of Android-specific APIs for reactivity.

The app is written in Kotlin, and uses
the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI toolkit, the current state
of the art for Android UI development.

## Stack

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
    - For some Material components, the View-based
      [Material Components Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
      (MDC-Android) library is used.
