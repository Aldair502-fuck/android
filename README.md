# Revolt for Android

## Description

This is the official Android app for the [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) chat platform.  
The codebase includes the app itself, as well as an internal library for interacting with the Revolt
API.

| Module      | Package                | Description          |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `:app`      | `chat.revolt`          | The main app module. |
| `:markdown` | `chat.revolt.markdown` | Markdown library.    |

The API library is part of the `app` module, and is not intended to be used as a standalone library,
as it makes liberal use of Android-specific APIs for reactivity.

The app is currently in alpha, and is not yet ready for production use.

The app is written in Kotlin, and uses
the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI toolkit, the current state
of the art for Android UI development.
