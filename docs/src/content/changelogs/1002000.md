## This is here to pad out the changelog

Hello, this is a changelog. It's here to tell you about the changes in this version. It's a good
idea to read it so you know what's new. If you don't read it, you might miss out on some cool new
features.

It opens in a bottom sheet now. It already did but we now switched to XML for the layout. This
means it is now better because Jetpack Compose bottom sheets are still funky.

## This is a table

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Row 2    | Row 3    |
| Row 2    | Row 3    | Row 4    |
| Row 3    | Row 4    | Row 5    |

This is my favourite app:
